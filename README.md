## gifcap

A shell script to record GIFs from your Android devices

A picture is worth 1,000 words - and, when prototyping animations, recording visual glitches, etc, a video is
worth far more.  This script makes it easy to capture and share subtle app behavior by producing ready-to-paste-in-Slack
GIFs with a single command.

### Install

OSX:
```bash
brew install gifcap
```

Others:
Ensure `adb`, `ffmpeg`, and `ffprobe` are on your $PATH.  Also make sure that your console window is
capable of executing `bash`.

Copy `gifcap.sh` and place it somewhere on your $PATH.
